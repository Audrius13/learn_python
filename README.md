exercises and solutions

## exercise 1
Create a program that asks the user to enter their name and their age. Print out a message addressed to them that tells them the year that they will turn 100 years old.

### Extras:

    Add on to the previous program by asking the user for another number and printing out that many copies of the previous message. (Hint: order of operations exists in Python)

## exercise 2
Ask the user for a number. Depending on whether the number is even or odd, print out an appropriate message to the user.

### Extras:

    If the number is a multiple of 4, print out a different message.
    
    Ask the user for two numbers: one number to check (call it num) and one number to divide by (check). If check divides evenly into num, tell that to the user. If not, print a different appropriate message.

## exercise 3
Write a program that prints out all the elements of the list that are less than 5.

### Extras:

    Instead of printing the elements one by one, make a new list that has all the elements less than 5 from this list in it and print out this new list.

    Write this in one line of Python.

    Ask the user for a number and return a list that contains only elements from the original list a that are smaller than that number given by the user.

## exercise 4
Create a program that asks the user for a number and then prints out a list of all the divisors of that number.

## exercise 5
Write a program that returns a list that contains only the elements that are common between the lists (without duplicates). Make sure your program works on two lists of different sizes.

### Extras:

    Randomly generate two lists to test this

## exercise 6
Ask the user for a string and print out whether this string is a palindrome or not. (A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards.)

## exercise 7
Let’s say I give you a list saved in a variable: a = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]. Write one line of Python that takes this list a and makes a new list that has only the even elements of this list in it.

## exercise 8
Make a two-player Rock-Paper-Scissors game. (Hint: Ask for player plays (using input), compare them, print out a message of congratulations to the winner, and ask if the players want to start a new game)

## exercise 9
Generate a random number between 1 and 9 (including 1 and 9). Ask the user to guess the number, then tell them whether they guessed too low, too high, or exactly right.

### Extras:

    Keep the game going until the user types “exit”
    Keep track of how many guesses the user has taken, and when the game ends, print this out.
